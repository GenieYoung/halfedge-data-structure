# halfedge-data-structure

A simple half-edge data structure, the majority of this code originates from [OpenMesh](https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/software/openmesh/)(A generic and efficient polygon mesh data structure), with key functions reorganized and the framework simplified for easier learning and application.

Just include the halfedge.h file into your project.

Provided a simple test, use "g++ test.cpp -o test" for compile
